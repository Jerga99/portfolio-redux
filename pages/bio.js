                  <p>
                  I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and several years of experience working
                  on a wide range of technologies and projects from C++ development for ultrasound devices to
                   modern mobile and web applications in React and Angular.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Throughout my career, I have acquired advanced technical knowledge and the ability to explain
                  programming topics clearly and in detail to a broadÂ audience. I invite you to take my course,
                  where I have put a lot of effort to explain web and software engineering concepts in a detailed,
                  hands-on and understandable way.
